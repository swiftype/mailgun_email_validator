# mailgun_email_validator

This gem adds a ``validates_as_email_with_mailgun`` method to ActiveRecord. It first tries to verify an e-mail using the amazing Mailgun e-mail validation API and then falls back to using the [spectator_validates_email](https://github.com/spectator/validates_email) gem if it can't connect.

## Usage

Add the gem to your Rails project's Gemfile, then bundle install to get started.

`gem 'mailgun_email_validator'`

You'll need to add a ``MAILGUN_PUBLIC_KEY`` environmental variable to your system, for instance in your ``~/.bash_profile``:

``export MAILGUN_PUBLIC_KEY='f23oifj3ojo2j3ofj32ijoj2iojf3iojoi2f32'``

Alternatively, you can configure mailgun with an initializer:


config/initializers/mailgun_email_validator.rb
``MailgunEmailValidator::MAILGUN_PUBLIC_KEY = 'f23oifj3ojo2j3ofj32ijoj2iojf3iojoi2f32'``

*Note: This is not a real Mailgun public key*


To use mailgun_email_validator inside your models:

`validates_as_email_with_mailgun :email`

You can also specify many of the usual ActiveRecord validation options including ``:on``, ``:allow_nil``, ``:allow_blank``, and ``:message``.


There is also a helper method available on all models:

``MyModel#valid_email_with_mailgun?(email) => true/false``
